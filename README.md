### To test locally

Run `netlify dev --live`. Should see some output like this:

`https://<your-dev-url>/.netlify/functions/<function-name>` e.g. `https://eb389059--bodega-labs-functions.netlify.live/.netlify/functions/sendDemoEmail`

(Note: function name in URL is case-sensitive)

Can hit that public dev link and code updates will reflect live. Console logs will log to the command line.
